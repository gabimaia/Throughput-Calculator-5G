# Initializing
- After installing the project dependencies (pandas, tkinter), the code should be executed in a Python version higher than 3.0. No additional parameters should be passed along with the algorithm execution.

- If everything goes well, the calculator interface will be displayed, and boxes will be available for entering the parameters (direction, date, modulation order, bandwidth, aggregated carriers, MIMO layers, frame, spacing carriers, and scaling factor). All parameters are inputs.

- At the bottom of the interface, the results will be displayed, calculated based on the input parameters. A log will be shown if the parameters are inconsistent.

- The displayed results will include throughput, numerology, the number of PRBs, and overhead. The number of PRBs will be calculated based on the standard tables for FR 1 and 2, and will be obtained from the band and carrier spacing.
